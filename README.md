# Keyboard Trainer

This is a music education rhythm game app that uses an ASP.NET core backend and Angular frontend. 

How it Works:
* Song information, including notes and rests, are all passed form the ASP.NET controllers to the Angular frontend
* The keyboard shows noteblock animations and lights up based on the current note in the song
* When the user presses the correct note, they gain accuracy points and move on to the next note
